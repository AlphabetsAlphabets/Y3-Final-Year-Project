This is a project I decided to work on for my thesis for my final year of university. It is a productivity application meant to help you keep track of your time. The goal is when you actively begin tracking your time, you'll be aware of how you spend your time. You are also able to reflect on your time spent by viewing a simple summary and looking at a calendar view.

**!!IMPORTANT!!**
This application is meant to be **offline only**, which means you can use it with or without an internet connection. However, what this also means is that data is not synced between devices. This means data present in your phone and computer will be entirely different. For this reason, it is important that you choose a specific device to use it on.

# How to use it
It is intended for this application to be used on and off over a period of time. You are advised to use it for 2-3 weeks to establish your existing behaviour. After that point, you are free to continue tracking or not. A few weeks after you stop tracking, you are expected to return to the application and repeat the cycle.

## Summary page
This is where you view data about your time spent. How you spend your time in a week, month, year, etc. You can choose the date range you want. You can choose to either view your stats by activity or by project. You can filter by hours or minutes as well. A pie chart will be presented to show how much time you spent on a project or activity. You can also download the data in the form of a CSV.

## Home page
The home page is the main page where you track your activities and link them with projects. For example, a project is broad and an activity is specific. Examples:
1. If you have a "gym" project, the activities could be "arms", "legs", etc.
2. If you're tracking time to be able to properly bill someone, you'll group projects based on actual project names. If the project is "Make a website", activities could be "research", "design", etc. This is just a recommendation. You can use this however you'd like.

## Calendar page
The calendar page is where you manage your tracked activities after it is said and done. You can delete logs, create new ones, update existing ones, edit their start and end times, etc. You can generally see what you've worked on for the week.

## Task page
This is where you manage your tasks. The distinct between activity and task is the importance. You'd keep track of a task, and an activity is something you happen to be doing. For example, reading a book. But if it is serious, like something for a freelance job, you'd put it under task. You can edit tasks, mark them as completed, so on and so forth.
