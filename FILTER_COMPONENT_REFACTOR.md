# Filter Component Refactoring

## Overview

The summary page has been refactored to separate filtering functionality into a reusable `Filter.svelte` component. This improves code organization, maintainability, and reusability.

## Architecture

### Component Structure

```
src/routes/summary/
├── +page.svelte          # Main summary page
├── Filter.svelte         # Filtering component
├── types.ts             # TypeScript interfaces
├── time_distributions.ts # Data processing utilities
└── charts.ts            # Chart configuration
```

### Data Flow

1. **Filter Component** → Dispatches `filterChange` events
2. **Main Page** → Receives events and updates data
3. **Chart & Stats** → Re-render with filtered data

## Filter Component API

### Props (Bindable)
```typescript
export let selectedOption: FilterOption = "activity";
export let startDate: string = "";
export let endDate: string = "";
```

### Events
```typescript
dispatch("filterChange", {
  selectedOption: "activity" | "project",
  startDate: string,
  endDate: string
});
```

## Usage

### In Parent Component
```svelte
<script>
  import Filter from "./Filter.svelte";
  
  let selectedOption = "activity";
  let startDate = "";
  let endDate = "";
  
  const handleFilterChange = (event) => {
    const { selectedOption, startDate, endDate } = event.detail;
    // Process filter changes
  };
</script>

<Filter
  bind:selectedOption
  bind:startDate
  bind:endDate
  on:filterChange={handleFilterChange}
/>
```

## Features Moved to Filter Component

### 1. View Type Selection
- Dropdown to switch between Activity and Project views
- Automatic event dispatching on change

### 2. Date Range Selection
- Manual date input fields (From/To)
- Clear dates functionality
- Automatic validation and event dispatching

### 3. Quick Preset Buttons
- Today, Yesterday
- This Week, Last Week
- This Month, Last Month
- Automatic date calculation and setting

## TypeScript Support

### New Types
```typescript
interface FilterChangeEvent {
  selectedOption: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
}

type FilterOption = "activity" | "project";

type PresetRange = "today" | "yesterday" | "thisWeek" | 
                   "lastWeek" | "thisMonth" | "lastMonth";
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

### ✅ **Separation of Concerns**
- Main page focuses on data display and processing
- Filter component handles user input and validation
- Clear responsibility boundaries

### ✅ **Reusability**
- Filter component can be used in other summary views
- Consistent filtering behavior across the application
- Easy to extend with new filter types

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Smaller, focused components are easier to debug
- Filter logic is isolated and testable
- Cleaner code organization

### ✅ **Type Safety**
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all interactions
- Compile-time validation of filter states
- Better IDE support and autocomplete

## Event Flow

```
User Action → Filter Component → filterChange Event → Main Page
    ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
Select Date → Update State → Dispatch Event → Process Filters
    ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
Set Preset → Calculate Range → Notify Parent → Update Charts
```

## Styling

All original styles have been preserved:
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Consistent Carbon Design System styling
- Hover and focus states maintained
- Grid layouts for preset buttons

## Future Enhancements

The component architecture now supports easy extension:

### Potential Additions
- **Custom Date Ranges**: User-defined preset ranges
- **Advanced Filters**: Time of day, duration filters
- **Filter Persistence**: Save filter states in localStorage
- **Filter Presets**: User-defined filter combinations
- **Export Integration**: Include filter state in exports

### Component Composition
```svelte
<Filter on:filterChange={handleFilterChange}>
  <DateRangeSelector slot="date-range" />
  <CustomPresets slot="presets" />
  <AdvancedFilters slot="advanced" />
</Filter>
```

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None - the API remains the same from the parent's perspective

### Behavioral Changes
- None - all filtering functionality works identically

### Performance Improvements
- Slightly better performance due to component isolation
- Easier garbage collection of filter-specific state
- Reduced re-renders in main component

## Testing Considerations

The refactoring enables better testing strategies:

### Unit Tests
- Filter component logic can be tested independently
- Event dispatching can be verified in isolation
- Date calculations can be tested separately

### Integration Tests
- Parent-child communication can be tested
- End-to-end filter workflows can be validated
- Multiple filter interactions can be verified
